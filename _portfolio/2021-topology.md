Applied persistent homology, a toolset to analyse high-dimensional data using topological data analysis, to motor control, which includes stride-to-stride fluctuations and gait dynamics, and neurodegenerative diseases. I conducted a detailed literature survey to explore obstacle avoidance, negotiation, and ageing in healthy adults. I studied group theory, algebraic topology (simplicial complexes) applied to sensor networks, time-series data.
