I am a second-year PhD student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, Atlanta. Currently, I am a member of the [MÄ€RGA](https://marga.ece.gatech.edu/) research group which is directed by [Prof. Karthikeyan Sundaresan](https://karthik.ece.gatech.edu/).

Broadly, I am interested in wireless networks and sensing. In particular, I am interested in building systems that aim to solve fundamental challenges in the wireless domain. This involves developing algorithms with robust guarantees and prototyping hardware which can leverage these algorithms. More information about my work can be found [here](/research/). 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's Degree with honours in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on online decision making geared towards edge computing in stochastic and adversarial environments under the supervision of [Prof. Sharayu Moharir](https://sites.google.com/view/sharayu-homepage/home).
