collection: publications
permalink: /research/2023-edgecomputing
excerpt: 'This paper is about Better-Late-Than-Never (BLTN), an online algorithm which decides the state of an edge computing server based on historic request arrival rates. In this work, we propose a deterministic online policy and characterize its performance for adversarial and stochastic request arrival processes. We also characterize a fundamental bound on the performance of an arbitrary deterministic online policy. Further, we compare the performance of our policy with suitably modified versions of existing policies to conclude that our policy is robust to temporal changes in the intensity of request arrivals.'
