excerpt: '*NeTo-X* is a scalable network tomography framework that maps interference patterns and estimates joint client access statistics with only linear overhead—paving the way for more efficient dynamic spectrum access in future networks. By exploiting multi-channel diversity and the spatial locality of interference, *NeTo-X* accurately infers interference statistics from simple pairwise client measurements. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in resource management and jammer localization, where it outperforms baselines and approaches optimal performance while remaining highly scalable.'

This paper is about *NeTo-X*, a scalable network tomography framework which estimates joint client access statistics with just linear overhead, and forms a blue-print of the interference, thus enabling efficient DSA for future networks. *NeTo-X*’s design incorporates intelligent algorithms that leverage multi-channel diversity and the spatial locality of interference impact on clients to accurately estimate the desired interference statistics from just pair-wise measurements of its clients. The merits of its framework are showcased in the context of resource management and jammer localization applications, where its performance significantly outperforms baseline approaches and closely approximates optimal performance at a scalable overhead.
